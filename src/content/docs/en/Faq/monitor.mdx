### Monitoring Types

Smart monitoring dynamically adjusts the polling time based on live status, live history, and monitoring metrics. <br />
If real-time performance is critical, it is recommended to enable real-time monitoring. <br />
If the live broadcast time is fixed, it is recommended to enable scheduled monitoring.

### Number of Monitors

Currently, no stress test has been performed, so there is no valid data on the maximum number of simultaneous monitors on a single platform.

### Monitoring Metrics

The monitoring metrics will count the live stream request data within five minutes, and a global alarm will be triggered when abnormal metrics appear.
